For the footer site nav, you could have also used border right or left in CSS instead creating a span and css for hiding the pipes.

Naming your responsive css file "media" is a bit confusing. My first thought was images or video or something along those lines. You can call it responsive.css or media-queries.css or something like that.

The page looks great and scales down nicely but one of the requirements for this assignment was to make it fluid responsive. The media queries for 880px and below default to a fixed width which is appropriate for an adaptive site. The 1280px down to 939px were a good use of fluid and responsive techniques.

The @font-face declaration links to different font files but there is only the .tff file in your font folders.

Avoid declarations like this. Either you write the declarations as shorthand or longhand (though shorthand is ideal) not declare it shorthand and then immediately override the values using shorthand.
